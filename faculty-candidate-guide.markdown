Dear faculty candidate,

I recently completed a job search (in 2013-2014 hiring season) for a tenure-track faculty position in Computer Science. I found lots of advice on the internet about how to write cover letters and CVs, how to prepare for interviews, etc. While that advice was useful, it was also very general and failed to give me a sense of what really happens in a job search.

What follows is my experience. Now that I have secured a tenure-track position at a small liberal arts college, I feel qualified to give some advice. Note that I was looking for a primarily teaching position rather than a primarily research position. In many ways, my experience is unique. Even so, it serves as a "data point" from which you can draw your own conclusions.

# Some statistics

- 58 tenure-track openings in Computer Science (it was a good year for CS grads). There were more that I didn't record, mostly in states where my wife and I didn't want to live.
- 33 applications sent
- 12 phone/Skype interview requests (some I denied); 4 of those were Skype or Google Hangout (video) interviews
- 7 campus interviews requested, 4 taken
- 3 concurrent job offers
- 1 job offer accepted: Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stetson University

Here are some facts about time:

- October (late) – January (early): application due dates (some fell outside this range)
- December – February: phone/Skype interviews
- January (late) – March (early): on-campus interviews
- First week of March: all offers were made; I contacted schools that didn't offer me a job, and they also seemed to be making their offers at the same time

# Find job openings

I mostly used these websites to search for jobs:

- [Vitae (The Chronicle of Higher Education)](https://chroniclevitae.com/job_search?job_search)
- [AcademicJobsOnline.org](http://academicjobsonline.org/ajo)
- And the SIGCSE mailing list, a computer science education list.

# Keep track of your applications

I made a spreadsheet to keep track of job openings and the status of my applications. For each school, I made a folder on my computer in which I put my cover letter, CV, etc. In the spreadsheet, I kept track of a variety of information:

| Folder | Status | School | City | State | Position | Source | Deadline | Link |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ----- | -------- | ------ | -------- | ---- |
| stetson | Submitted 11/23/2013 | Stetson University | DeLand | Florida | Assistant Professor | SIGCSE | Open | Email from 11/12/2013 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

The "Link" column often contained a web address where I saw the original job posting, or the date of an email. The "Deadline" column contained a date or "Open" to indicate that the school was reviewing applications all the time.

I'm surprised that I applied to Stetson even though it had an "Open" deadline. The open deadlines really stressed me out. It meant that there might be other candidates submitting their applications today and that I'm already behind. On the other hand, a strict deadline (say, 12/15/2013) meant that I could prioritize sending my applications so that I made sure to get them all in on time. I found open deadlines to be so stressful that I often didn't apply to those schools. Schools should give strict deadlines to make their applicants' lives easier.

# Update your materials for each application

Make sure you appropriately update your cover letter, CV, research statement, teaching statement, etc. for each application. There is abundant advice on the internet about how to do this. Keep these school-specific files in a folder with the name of the school (and use your spreadsheet to keep track of these folder names). If you get an interview, you'll want to refresh your memory of how you "sold" yourself in your application for that school, and refresh your memory of what they are looking for in an applicant.

Some websites, such as [AcademicJobsOnline.org](http://academicjobsonline.org/ajo), will save your colleagues' letters of recommendation, so if you apply to another school using that website, you won't have to ask your colleagues to send their letters again. That is very convenient, since they may not always respond as fast as you wish (especially if you are up against an application deadline).

# Establish your personal website

My personal website is my OSU graduate student website: [http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~eckroth](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~eckroth). If you search for my name, "Joshua Eckroth" on Google, that website appears first. That's exactly what I want. I control its contents, and there is good reason for it to focus on my academic pursuits (since it's hosted at OSU).

I intentionally included my picture on the website. I'm a white male. I want that to be known up front. I believe in affirmative action and, particularly in computer science, white males are significantly overrepresented. If a school is primarily looking for someone who is not a white male, then I applaud that, and they shouldn't choose me!

## 1 Install Google Analytics on your website

Visit [http://analytics.google.com](http://analytics.google.com/) and figure out how to start tracking your personal website visitors (by the way, it's free). My website has only a single page, so I'm not tracking how they peruse my website. Rather, I'm looking at where they come from, what time of day, etc.

Google Analytics can show the country, state, and city of each person who visits your site. I was able to determine what days (and what hours of the day) people at particular schools were visiting my site. I saw that someone in DeLand, Florida (the location of Stetson University) visited my site. I saw a flurry of activity from other locations just before they offered me a phone or campus interview.

By obsessively checking this information, I was able to track interest in my job applications. Of course, just knowing that somebody from Springfield, USA visited your website does not mean that you'll get a job at Springfield University. But if you're the obsessive type, it's a good tool.

# Prepare for a phone/video interview

For phone interviews, you have the advantage of being able to look at notes. I wrote possible questions and answers on note cards.

Here are some questions that were actually asked:

- What interests you about this position (at a small liberal arts school)?
- What courses in the typical CS curriculum would you be comfortable teaching?
- How would you be able to involve undergraduates and faculty in your research?
- How would you go about teaching non-majors and what role do you see for computer science at a liberal arts school?
- **What is it about (this school) that you like? Why do you want to work here?** (Have a good answer!)
- Which of our courses can you teach, and have you taught before?
- What’s hard about teaching and how do I fix it?
- How have you handled: cheating, a student who's not succeeding, increasing diversity?
- Tell us about yourself.
- Why do I think I got (certain teaching awards)?
- My area is out of the ordinary; how will I interest students and make my research useful for them?
- **Do you have any questions for us?** (I was always asked this question. Be sure you do have questions!)

I also compiled a collection of personal stories addressing various aspects of my teaching and research experiences. I found this useful because it's sometimes hard to remember what you've done when you in the middle of an interview. You should become comfortable telling these stories over and over again to different interviewers. I also found myself telling the same stories to different people during the same campus interview.

I've been through a couple Skype interviews, and I thought I'd share what I believe are some good ideas.

- Find a location with a neutral background (i.e., what's behind your head in the video). I usually headed to the library and tried to steal a group study room. Then I put the white board behind me. Perhaps I would appear more interesting and professorial if I had a stack of ungraded papers and a chaotic bookcase in view, but perhaps not.
- Avoid drinking anything, because when you take a drink, they see a huge water bottle or cup which might be a bit startling. If you do need a drink, turn your head sideways. Try to respect the distance between the camera and yourself (don't lean forward too often either).
- Wear something nice. I suppose you only need to wear a nice shirt/top but you might feel better wearing full interview attire. And who knows, maybe something drops and you have to stand up momentarily.
- Use a headset microphone and headphones if you can. They probably won't do the same, and in my experience there are several people in view (so of course they're not all wearing mics). But, they should hear you as clearly as possible. You also want headphones so that nobody experiences echo, which can sometimes happen as your mic picks up their words coming out of your speakers.
- Use body language to your advantage. And read their body language. I found it hard to keep my hand gestures in view. Practice with your camera beforehand, and figure out what distance you need to be so that they get the right view.

I wish there was a way to make it appear like you are looking them in the eyes, but you'd have to look directly at your camera, which means you aren't looking at their faces. But I figure that's an awkwardness that everyone expects.

# Prepare for an on-campus interview

(Most of those "(open)" times were filled with meetings or other activities; I don't remember the details.)

These two campus interviews were very different experiences. The former was a state school, and everybody seemed very stressed and were really hoping they would not have to interview any other candidates. The latter was a very expensive, very small liberal arts school who really wanted to be sure they found the best person. (NB: Neither of these interviews were with Stetson University.) The state school did not ask me to meet with students, while the liberal arts school gave me multiple opportunities to meet students. They even set up a private lunch with students. The former school just wanted my research talk, while the latter school asked that I give a research talk (during their typical colloquium time) and teach a class. I was able to choose which class I was to teach, among a few options. We worked together on my teaching materials to make sure it was appropriate for the students. Finally, because the liberal arts school was so small, I was able to meet with its president.

I was able to reuse my research talk for every interview, with very minimal modifications on a few occasions. I also used 90% of that presentation for my thesis defense a couple months later. Sometimes I modified the talk to add some "flair" for a specific school. The audiences for the research talk ranged from about eight people to about one hundred (the colloquium setting).

Obviously, my teaching experiences were unique to each school. Sometimes, I had very little time to prepare (one week or so). Some schools asked that I teach an entire 1.3 hour class, others asked that I give a 15 minute lecture. As shown in the first schedule above, one school did not ask me to give a teaching talk/lecture.

One other interesting difference between schools (but not related to their size or status) was whether alcohol was offered to me. For some schools, the issue never came up, and nobody offered me any (though sometimes they purchased a drink for themselves). I figure I could have purchased a drink as well and it would not have been an issue. The search chair at another school bought me a drink just to be sure I had at least one drink while I was there. Faculty at another school let me drink freely, as did they. Nobody drank more than 2-3 drinks each meal (dinner), however.

Some common elements:

- Meetings with deans, presidents, provosts mostly seem to center on two things: (1) determining if you're smart, capable, passionate, etc.; (2) telling you the mission of the school, where it is going and where it has been, etc. These people presumably must "approve" any job offer the faculty which to extend to you.
- Schools usually want to reimburse your expenses as soon as possible. Be sure to keep your receipts, including taxi rides, airport food, baggage claim tickets, etc.
- They'll want you to fly to the nearest airport, even if it's a small expensive airport.
- They'll want you to stay in town for the fewest number of nights (so their hotel bill is not larger than it has to be). But there is no need to take a red-eye flight.
- Somebody will be your host, primarily responsible for taking you to the next meeting.
- You will probably have no time to prepare for presentations; do that in hotel or before your visit.

Some advice:

- Dress well, though except for the dean/president/provots, you'll be overdressed.
- Wear comfortable (business) shoes.

When you're on a campus interview, you'll also want to evaluate whether or not you would be happy working there. Look for:

- General attitude of faculty. Are they depressed? Do they talk about lost opportunities or not being appreciated?
- General attitude of students. Are they accustomed to being abused? Are they happy to be there?
- What is the cost of living? Where do the professors live? How long is their commute? Are they expected to stay late?
- What is their faculty search time table? Are you the first or last person? (I'm not sure how it matters, but it gives you a good idea how long you have to wait for an offer.)

# Accept an offer

I have no particular advice about negotiating. I avoided doing so myself, and only requested some startup funds for computer hardware. I had three simulataneous offers in the first week of March. I called the fourth school that I visited, and learned that they had made their offers to other candidates.

Actually, the day after I got home from my last campus interview, that same school made me an offer. They wanted me to accept the offer immediately. The two other schools gave me seven days. It was a very stressful time but, luckily, the decision was rather easy.

# Final words

This process was exhausting. The campus interviews were especially exhausting for me. In just two months' time, I flew in 20 airplanes, mostly across the country. Simultaneously, I was teaching a course, finishing my thesis, and writing software for a startup company. It was so exhausting and stressful that immediately after my last campus interview, I was diagnosed with an unusual and stress-induced disease which made my life even more difficult (and painful) for a few weeks. Also immediately after my last campus interview, each school made its offer. That was a very intense weekend! Ultimately, it all worked out. I wish you luck on your own search!
